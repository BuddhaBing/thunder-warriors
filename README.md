## The Project

This is the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) final two-week group project. [We](#collaborators) decided to build a 3D [Tower Defence] video game using the [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) multi platform game development tool.

After some discussion, we settled on an 80s theme for the game, and the name "Thunder Warriors" came from an 80s random name generator!

[None of us](#collaborators) had ever created a video game, or coded in C# before, so it was a brand new challenge for all of us. We had two weeks to learn how to use the Unity platform, learn a new language, and to create a video game using this newly acquired knowledge.

The first few days were spent researching and playing about with Unity, and then we were ready to start building. By the end of the first week, we had hit our Minimum Viable Product, but we were not happy with the quality of the code base and it ignored a lot of the design patterns and best practices that weâ€™d learned over the last 12 weeks at Makers Academy.

On the Monday of the second (and final) week, we took the brave step of starting a huge refactor of the existing code, so that we could hopefully finish the project with a well structured and testable code base.

Cleaning up the code and making it testable, whilst trying to keep the same level of game functionality was a challenge, and one that took as long to achieve as it did for us to hit our Minimum Viable Product.

But it was worth it, we learnt a lot during the process and the code is now much more extendable. We now plan on developing new features and levels for the game.

## <a name="rules">Game Rules</a>

* Players can place towers on the designated tower nodes in order to destroy enemies.
* Towers cost gold to buy.
* Each enemy killed gives the player additional gold.
* Some towers can be upgraded (this also costs gold).
* Towers can be sold in return for gold.
* If an enemy makes it to the end of the route, the player loses a life.
* If the player loses all their lives, the game is over.
* If the player endures all of the enemy waves without losing all their lives, the level is complete.

## <a name="install">Installation</a>

The game cannot be installed as such from this repo, as it relies on paid assets from the Unity Asset Store. This repo serves as an example of the code behind the game mechanics. The C# scripts driving the game can be found in the folder: /Assets/80std/Script/

We have an associated [repo here](https://github.com/treborb/thunder-warriors), which contains instructions for installing the game so that it can be run locally and played in the browser.
